## Overview

Oxyon is a desktop multimedia toolkit built with Rust and [egui](https://github.com/emilide/egui). It handles file conversion, renaming, tagging and scraping in a single GUI application, with bundled binaries (ffmpeg, ffprobe, mkvpropedit) — no external tools to install.

**Oxyon Desk** is a lightweight variant with only document and image conversion, no bundled binaries and no API calls.

Available in English and French.

- **Audio** — MP3, FLAC, AAC, OGG conversion via ffmpeg
- **Documents** — DOCX, PDF, Markdown, ODT, HTML, LaTeX conversion (pure Rust, no pandoc)
- **Pictures** — 15+ formats including AVIF, JXL, RAW, SVG, PSD, WebP, EXR
- **Video/MKV tagging** — Write metadata (title, watched status, etc.) to Matroska files
- **Media scraping** — Fetch movie/series metadata from TMDB
- **File renamer** — Find/replace, insert, delete, numbering, case transform, extension editing with live preview
