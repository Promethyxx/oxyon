# Organizing Your Current Issues

Since you have 9 open issues that are features, here's how to organize them:

## 📋 Steps to Organize

1. **Go to each issue** in your repository
2. **Add the label** "enhancement" or "feature"
3. **Use this template** to describe each feature clearly:

```markdown
## 🚀 Feature: [Feature Name]

### What it does
[Brief description]

### Why it's needed
[Use case or problem it solves]

### Implementation ideas
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

### Status
- [ ] Planning
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Done
```

## 🏷️ Suggested Labels

Create these labels in your repository (Settings > Issues > Labels):

- `enhancement` - New features
- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `documentation` - Improvements to docs
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention needed
- `priority: high` - Critical features
- `priority: medium` - Important features
- `priority: low` - Nice to have

## 📊 Example Organization

### High Priority Features
- Batch processing
- Progress bars
- Error handling improvements

### Medium Priority Features
- Custom presets
- Settings persistence
- UI improvements

### Low Priority Features
- Themes
- Localization
- Advanced options

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Milestones**: Group related features into milestones (e.g., "v1.0", "v1.1")
2. **Projects**: Use GitHub Projects to visualize your roadmap
3. **Priorities**: Tag 2-3 features as "priority: high" to focus your work
4. **Regular Updates**: Comment on issues with progress updates

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Review all 9 issues
2. Add appropriate labels
3. Update descriptions using the template above
4. Close any duplicates or outdated issues
5. Create a milestone for your next release

This will make your project look more professional and help potential contributors understand your vision!
